Sven Magnus Øen Carlsen[a] (born 30 November 1990) is a Norwegian chess grandmaster. Carlsen is a five-time World Chess Champion, five-time World Rapid Chess Champion, the reigning (shared with Ian Nepomniachtchi) eight time World Blitz Chess Champion and the reigning Chess World Cup Champion. He has held the No. 1 position in the FIDE world chess rankings since 1 July 2011 and trails only Garry Kasparov in time spent as the highest-rated player in the world.[1] His peak rating of 2882 is the highest in history. He also holds the record for the longest unbeaten streak at the elite level in classical chess at 125 games.[2][3]

A chess prodigy, Carlsen finished first in the C group of the Corus chess tournament shortly after he turned 13 and earned the title of grandmaster a few months later. At 15, he won the Norwegian Chess Championship, and later became the youngest ever player to qualify for the Candidates Tournament in 2005.[1] At 17, he finished joint first in the top group of Corus. He surpassed a rating of 2800 at 18, the youngest at the time to do so. In 2010, at 19, he reached No. 1 in the FIDE world rankings, the youngest person ever to do so.

Carlsen became World Chess Champion in 2013 by defeating Viswanathan Anand. He retained his title against Anand the following year and won both the 2014 World Rapid Championship and World Blitz Championship, becoming the first player to hold all three titles simultaneously, a feat which he repeated in 2019 and 2022.[4][5] He defended his classical world title against Sergey Karjakin in 2016, Fabiano Caruana in 2018, and Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021. Carlsen declined to defend his title in 2023, citing a lack of motivation.[6]

Known for his attacking style as a teenager, Carlsen has since developed into a universal player. He uses a variety of openings to make it harder for opponents to prepare against him and reduce the utility of pre-game computer analysis.[7]

Childhood
Carlsen was born in Tønsberg, Norway, on 30 November 1990[8][9] to Sigrun Øen (1963–2024), a chemical engineer, and Henrik Albert Carlsen, an IT consultant.[10] The family spent one year in Espoo, Finland, and then in Brussels, Belgium, before returning to Norway in 1998, where they lived in Lommedalen, Bærum. They later moved to Haslum.[11] Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age. At two years, he could solve 50-piece jigsaw puzzles; at four, he enjoyed assembling Lego sets with instructions intended for children aged 10–14.[12]

His father, a keen amateur chess player,[13] taught him to play at the age of five, although he initially showed little interest in it.[14] He has three sisters, stated that his motivation to study chess seriously was to beat his elder sister at the game.[15]


Carlsen, aged 13, in Molde giving a simultaneous exhibition, July 2004
Carlsen developed his early chess skills by playing by himself. Carlsen had an exceptional memory and could recall the locations, populations, flags and capitals of all the countries in the world by the age of five.[16] He participated in his first tournament—the youngest division of the 1999 Norwegian Chess Championship—at 8 years and 7 months, and scored 6/11.[17]

Carlsen was coached at the Norwegian College of Elite Sport by the country's top player, Grandmaster (GM) Simen Agdestein,[10] who in turn cites Norwegian football manager Egil "Drillo" Olsen as a key inspiration for his coaching strategy.[18] In 2000, Agdestein introduced Carlsen to Torbjørn Ringdal Hansen, a former Norwegian junior champion and later International Master (IM) and GM,[19] as Ringdal served a one-year siviltjeneste (an alternative civilian service programme) at the college.

Over the course of that year, Carlsen's rating rose from 904 in June 2000 to 1907. His breakthrough occurred in the Norwegian junior teams championship in September 2000, where he scored 3½/5 against the country's top junior players and gained a tournament performance rating (TPR) of around 2000.[20] Apart from chess, which he studied about three to four hours a day, his favourite pastimes included playing football and reading Donald Duck comics.[21] He also practised skiing until the age of ten.[22]

From autumn 2000 to the end of 2002, Carlsen played almost 300 rated tournament games, as well as in several blitz tournaments, and participated in other minor events.[23] In October 2002, he placed sixth in the European Under-12 Championship in Peñiscola.[24] The following month, he tied for first place in the 2002 World Under-12 Championship in Heraklion, placing second to Ian Nepomniachtchi on tiebreak.[25] He then obtained three IM norms in relatively quick succession: the first at the January 2003 Gausdal Troll Masters (score 7/10, 2453 PR); the second at the June 2003 Salongernas IM-tournament in Stockholm (6/9, 2470 PR); and the third at the July 2003 Politiken Cup in Copenhagen (8/11, 2503 PR). He was officially awarded the IM title on 20 August 2003.[26]

After finishing primary school, Carlsen took a year off to participate in international chess tournaments in Europe during the autumn of 2003, then returned to complete secondary education at a sports school.[27][28] During the year away from school, he placed joint-third in the European Under-14 Championship[29] and ninth in the 2003 World Under-14 Championship.[30]

Carlsen made headlines after his victory, at the age of 13, in the C group at the 2004 Corus chess tournament in Wijk aan Zee.[31] He obtained a score of 10½/13, losing just one game (against the highest-rated player of the C group, Duško Pavasovič).[32] As a result, he earned his first GM norm, and achieved a PR of 2702. Particularly notable was his win over Sipke Ernst in the penultimate round, when he sacrificed material to give mate in just 29 moves.[33] His victory in the C group qualified him to play in the B group in 2005, and it led Lubomir Kavalek, writing for the Washington Post, to give him the title "the Mozart of chess" (although, as pointed out by Edward Winter, the nickname had been given to many illustrious predecessors).[34] Agdestein said that Carlsen had an excellent memory and played an unusually wide range of openings.[35] Carlsen's prowess caught the attention of Microsoft, which became his sponsor.[36]

Carlsen obtained his second GM norm at the Moscow Aeroflot Open in February. On 17 March, in a blitz chess tournament in Reykjavík, Iceland, he defeated former World Champion Anatoly Karpov. It was a preliminary event leading up to a rapid knockout tournament beginning the next day. In that event, Carlsen was paired with Garry Kasparov, then the top-rated player in the world. Carlsen achieved a draw in their first game but lost the second, and was thus knocked out of the tournament.[37]

In the sixth Dubai Open Chess Championship, held 18–28 April, Carlsen obtained his third GM norm, which made him the world's youngest GM at the time, and the second-youngest GM in history at the time (after Sergey Karjakin, who earned the title at 12 years and 7 months).[38] Carlsen played in the FIDE World Chess Championship, becoming the youngest player ever to participate in one, but was knocked out in the first round by Levon Aronian.[39]

In July, Carlsen and Berge Østenstad, then the reigning Norwegian champion, tied for first in the Norwegian Chess Championship, each scoring 7/9. A two-game match between them was arranged to decide the title. Both games were drawn, which left Østenstad the champion because he had superior tiebreaks in the tournament.[40]

2005
In the Smartfish Chess Masters event at the Drammen International Chess Festival 2004–05, Carlsen defeated Alexei Shirov, then ranked No. 10[41] in the world, as well as the co-winner of the tournament.[42] In the semi-finals of the Ciudad de León rapid chess tournament in June, Carlsen played a four-game match against Viswanathan Anand, who was ranked No. 2 in the world at the time and had won the 2003 World Rapid Chess Championship.[43] Anand won 3–1.[44]

In the Norwegian Chess Championship, Carlsen again finished in shared first place, this time with his mentor Simen Agdestein. A playoff between them was played between 7 and 10 November. This time, Carlsen had the better tiebreaks, but the rule giving the title to the player with better tiebreak scores in the event of a 1–1 tie had been revoked. The match was closely fought—Agdestein won the first game, Carlsen the second—so it went into a series of two-game rapid matches until there was a winner. Carlsen won the first rapid game, Agdestein the second. Then followed three draws until Agdestein won the championship title with a victory in the sixth rapid game.[45]

In October, Carlsen took first place at the Arnold Eikrem Memorial in Gausdal with a score of 8/9 and a PR of 2792.[46]


Carlsen in Warsaw, 2005
At the end of 2005, Carlsen participated at the Chess World Cup in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia. In the knockout tournament, he upset 44th-ranked Zurab Azmaiparashvili in round one, and proceeded to defeat Farrukh Amonatov and Ivan Cheparinov to reach the round of 16. There he lost to Evgeny Bareev,[47] but won against Joël Lautier and Vladimir Malakhov before losing again to Gata Kamsky. Carlsen finished in tenth place and became the youngest player to be an official World Championship Candidate.[48]

2006
Carlsen qualified for a place in the Corus B group due to his first-place finish in Corus group C in 2004. His shared first place with Alexander Motylev with 9/13 (+6−1=6) qualified him to play in the Corus group A in 2007.[49]

At the 2006 international 'Bosna' tournament in Sarajevo, Carlsen shared first place with Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu (who won on tiebreak evaluation) and Vladimir Malakhov; this could be regarded as Carlsen's first "A" elite tournament win, although it was not a clear first.[50]

Carlsen was close to winning the 2006 Norwegian Chess Championship outright, but a last-round loss to Berge Østenstad dropped him into another tie for first place with Agdestein. It also prevented Carlsen from beating Agdestein's record as the youngest Norwegian champion ever.[51] Nonetheless, in the playoff held from 19 to 21 September, Carlsen won 3–1. After two draws at standard time controls, Carlsen won both rapid games in round two, securing his first Norwegian championship win.[52]

Carlsen won the Glitnir Blitz Tournament in Iceland.[53] He achieved a 2–0 win over Viswanathan Anand in the semi-finals and achieved the same score in the finals.[54] He scored 6/8 in the 37th Chess Olympiad and achieved a PR of 2820.[55]

In the Midnight Sun Chess Tournament in Tromsø, Carlsen finished second to Sergei Shipov.[56] In the Biel Grandmaster Tournament, he placed second, beating the tournament winner Alexander Morozevich twice.[57]

In the NH Chess Tournament held in Amsterdam in August, Carlsen participated in an "Experience" vs. "Rising Stars" Scheveningen team match. The "Rising Stars" won the match 28–22, with Carlsen achieving the best individual score for the Rising Stars team (6½/10) and a 2700 PR, thus winning the right to participate in the 2007 Melody Amber tournament.[58]

With a score of 7½/15, Carlsen placed 8th out of 16 participants at the World Blitz Championship in Rishon LeZion, Israel.[59] In the rapid chess tournament Rencontres nationales et internationales d'échecs in Cap d'Agde, France, he reached the semi-final, losing there to Sergey Karjakin.[60] In November, Carlsen achieved a shared 8th place of 10 participants in the Mikhail Tal Memorial in Moscow with two losses and seven draws. He finished ninth in a group of 18 participants in the associated blitz tournament, which was won by Anand.[61]

2007

Carlsen playing Levon Aronian at Linares 2007
Playing in the top group of the Corus chess tournament for the first time, Carlsen placed last with nine draws and four losses, scoring 4½/13.[62] In the Linares chess tournament, Carlsen played against top-rated players Veselin Topalov, Viswanathan Anand, Peter Svidler, Alexander Morozevich, Levon Aronian, Peter Leko, and Vasyl Ivanchuk. Despite being rated significantly lower than any of them, he finished in second place on tiebreaks with 7½/14, having scored four wins, seven draws and three losses, and achieving a PR of 2778.[63]

Carlsen played for the first time in the Melody Amber blind and rapid chess tournament in Monte Carlo in March. In the 11 rounds, he achieved eight draws and three losses in the blindfold games, as well as three wins, seven draws and one loss in the rapid games. This resulted in a shared ninth place in the blindfold, shared second place in the rapid (behind Anand), and a shared eighth place overall.[64]

In May and June, he participated in the Candidates Tournament for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2007, facing Levon Aronian in a six-game match at standard time controls, which Carlsen drew (+2−2=2) by coming from behind twice. The four-game rapid playoff was drawn as well (+1−1=2), with Carlsen winning the last game to stay in the match. Eventually, Aronian eliminated Carlsen from the tournament after winning both tiebreak blitz games.[65]

In July and August, Carlsen won the Biel Grandmaster Tournament with a 6/10 record and a PR of 2753. His score was matched by Alexander Onischuk and they played a match to break the tie. After drawing two rapid and two blitz games, Carlsen won the armageddon game.[66] Immediately after the Biel tournament, Carlsen entered the open Arctic Chess Challenge in Tromsø, but his fourth-place result with +5=4 was a slight underperformance in terms of rating. In the first round, Carlsen conceded a draw to his classmate Brede Hagen (rated 2034)[67] after having a lost position at one point.[68] A game which attracted some attention was his sixth-round win over his father, Henrik Carlsen.[69]

Carlsen reached the semi-final round of the World Chess Cup in December, after defeating Michael Adams in the round of 16 and Ivan Cheparinov in the quarterfinals. In the semi-final, he was eliminated by the eventual winner, Gata Kamsky, scoring ½–1½.[70]

2008

Carlsen in 2008
In the top group A of the 69th Corus chess tournament, Carlsen scored 8/13, achieving a PR of 2830. Carlsen won five games, lost two and drew six, sharing first place with Levon Aronian.[71] At the Linares chess tournament, Carlsen had another 2800+ PR, scoring 8/14. He finished in sole second place, ½ point behind the winner World Champion Viswanathan Anand.[72]

In March, Carlsen played for the second time in the Melody Amber blind and rapid chess tournament, held in Nice for the first time. In the 11 rounds he achieved four wins, four draws and two losses in the blindfold, and three wins, two losses, and six draws in the rapid. This resulted in a shared fifth place in the blindfold, shared third place in the rapid and a shared second place in the overall tournament.[73]

Carlsen was one of 21 players in the six-tournament FIDE Grand Prix 2008–2010, a qualifier for the World Chess Championship 2012. In the first tournament, in Baku, Azerbaijan, he finished in a three-way tie for first place, with another 2800 PR. He later withdrew from the Grand Prix cycle despite his initial success, criticising FIDE for "changing the rules dramatically in the middle of a World Championship cycle".[74]

Carlsen won a rapid match against Peter Leko held in Miskolc, Hungary, scoring 5–3.[75] In June, Carlsen won the annual Aerosvit chess tournament,[76] finishing undefeated with 8/11 in a category 19 field and achieving a PR of 2877, his best PR at that point in his career.[77] Playing in the category 18 Biel Grandmaster Tournament, Carlsen finished third with 6/10, with a PR of 2740.[78]

In the Mainz World Rapid Chess Championship, Carlsen finished in second place after losing the final to defending champion Anand 3–1.[79] In the qualification round Carlsen scored 1½–½ against Judit Polgár, 1–1 against Anand and 1–1 against Alexander Morozevich.[80] In the category 22 Bilbao Masters, Carlsen tied for second with a 2768 PR.[81]

2009
Playing in Group A of the 71st Corus chess tournament, Carlsen tied for fifth with a 2739 PR.[82] In the Linares chess tournament, he finished third with a 2777 PR.[83] He tied for second place with Veselin Topalov at the M-Tel Masters (category 21) tournament in Sofia, Bulgaria. He lost to eventual winner Alexei Shirov in their final game, dropping him from first.[84]

Carlsen won the category 21 Nanjing Pearl Spring tournament, 2½ points ahead of second-place finisher Topalov, the world's highest-rated player at the time. He scored an undefeated 8/10, winning every game as white (against Topalov, Wang Yue, Leko, Teimour Radjabov, and Dmitry Jakovenko), and also winning as black against Jakovenko. By rating performance, this was one of the greatest results in history, with a PR of 3002.[85] Chess statistician Jeff Sonas has declared it one of the 20 best tournament performances of all time, and the best chess performance of all time by a teenager.[86]

In the Tal Memorial, played from 5 to 14 November, Carlsen started with seven straight draws, but finished with wins over former FIDE World Champion Ruslan Ponomariov and Peter Leko. This result put Carlsen in shared second place behind former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik and equal with Ivanchuk.[87][88] After the Tal Memorial, Carlsen won the World Blitz Championship, played from 16 to 18 November in Moscow, Russia. His score of 28 wins, 6 draws and 8 losses left him three points ahead of Anand, who finished in second place.[89]


Carlsen at the World Blitz Championship 2009
Carlsen entered the London Chess Classic as the top seed in a field including Kramnik, Hikaru Nakamura, Michael Adams, Nigel Short, Ni Hua, Luke McShane and David Howell. He defeated Kramnik in round one and went on to win the tournament with 13/21 (three points were awarded for a win, and one for a draw; using classical scoring he finished with 5/7) and a PR of 2844, one point ahead of Kramnik. This victory propelled him to No. 1 of the FIDE rating list, surpassing Veselin Topalov.[90][91]

Based on his average ranking from the July 2009 and January 2010 FIDE lists, Carlsen qualified for the Candidates Tournament that would determine the challenger to World Champion Viswanathan Anand in the World Chess Championship 2012. In November 2010, however, Carlsen announced he was withdrawing from the Candidates Tournament. Carlsen described the 2008–12 cycle as "[not] sufficiently modern and fair", and wrote that "Reigning champion privileges, the long (five-year) span of the cycle, changes made during the cycle resulting in a new format (Candidates) that no World Champion has had to go through since Kasparov, puzzling ranking criteria as well as the shallow ceaseless match-after-match concept are all less than satisfactory in my opinion."[92]

In early 2009 Carlsen engaged former World Champion Garry Kasparov as a personal trainer.[93] In September their partnership was revealed to the public by Norwegian newspapers.[94][95]

Responding to a question in an interview with Time magazine in December 2009 as to whether he used computers when studying chess, Carlsen explained that he does not use a chess set when studying on his own.[96]

2010
Carlsen won the 72nd Corus chess tournament played 16–31 January with 8½ points. His ninth-round loss to Kramnik ended a streak of 36 rated games undefeated.[97] Carlsen struggled in the last round against Fabiano Caruana, but saved a draw, leaving him half a point ahead of Kramnik and Shirov.[98]

In March it was announced that Carlsen had split from Kasparov and would no longer use him as a trainer,[99] although Carlsen later stated that they would remain in contact and he would continue to attend training sessions with Kasparov.[100]

Carlsen shared first place alongside Ivanchuk in the Amber blindfold and rapid tournament. Scoring 6½/11 in the blindfold and 8/11 in the rapid, Carlsen accumulated 14½ from a possible 22 points.[101] Carlsen helped Anand prepare for the World Chess Championship 2010 against Veselin Topalov, which Anand won 6½–5½ to retain the title. Carlsen had also helped Anand prepare for the World Chess Championships in 2007 and 2008.[102]

Carlsen won the Bazna Kings Tournament in Romania in June, two points ahead of Radjabov and Boris Gelfand.[103] In August, Carlsen played in the Arctic Securities Chess Stars tournament in Kristiansund, Norway., defeating Anand 1½–½ in the two-game final to win the championship.[104]

Carlsen suffered setbacks in his next two tournaments. In the 39th Chess Olympiad he scored 4½/8, losing three games, to Baadur Jobava, Michael Adams, and Sanan Sjugirov; these were his first losses with the black pieces in more than a year.[105] His team, Norway, finished 51st out of 149 teams.[106]

Carlsen played in the Grand Slam Masters Final in October, which he had qualified for automatically by winning three of the previous year's four Grand Slam chess events.[107][108] The average Elo of the participants at the time was 2789, making the Grand Slam Final the strongest chess tournament in history. In the first round, Carlsen lost with black to Kramnik; this was Carlsen's second consecutive loss to Kramnik, and placed his hold on the world No. 1 ranking in jeopardy. In his second round, Carlsen lost with the white pieces to Anand; this was his first loss as White since January 2010. Carlsen recovered somewhat in the latter part of the tournament, achieving a win over Shirov, and finishing with 2½/6; Kramnik won the event with 4/6.[109]

In October, Carlsen competed at the Pearl Spring chess tournament in Nanjing, China.[110] This was the only tournament in 2010 to feature Anand, Carlsen and Topalov, at the time the top three players in the world, and was the first tournament in history to feature three players rated at least 2800. Carlsen secured first place by defeating Topalov with black. This was his second victory in the tournament over the former world No. 1; his final score of 7/10 (with a PR of 2903) was a full point ahead of runner-up Anand.[111]


Carlsen at the 2010 London Chess Classic
On 5 November, Carlsen withdrew from the 2011 Candidates Tournament, having qualified as the highest rated challenger, citing dissatisfaction with the World Championship cycle format.[112]

In the World Blitz Championship, held in Moscow in November, Carlsen finished third with a score of 23½/38, behind Radjabov and winner Levon Aronian.[113] After the tournament, Carlsen played a private 40-game blitz match against Hikaru Nakamura,[114] winning with a score of 24½–15½.[115] Carlsen won the London Chess Classic in December, ahead of Anand and McShane.[116]

2011
Carlsen competed in the GM-A group of the 73rd Tata Steel Chess Tournament (formerly called the Corus chess tournament) on 14–30 January in Wijk aan Zee in an attempt to defend his title; the field included World Champion Viswanathan Anand, Levon Aronian, former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik, Alexander Grischuk, Hikaru Nakamura, Ruslan Ponomariov, among others. Despite losing games with white against Anish Giri and reigning Russian champion Ian Nepomniachtchi, Carlsen finished with 8/13, including victories over Kramnik and tournament winner Nakamura.[117] Although Carlsen's performance raised his rating from 2814 to 2815, Anand's 8½/13 score elevated his rating to 2817, making him the world No. 1 for the March 2011 FIDE rating list.[118]

The first tournament victory of the year came in the Bazna Kings tournament, a double round robin played in Mediaș, Romania on 11–21 June. Carlsen finished with 6½/10, equal with Sergey Karjakin but with a better tiebreak score. Carlsen won his White games against Nakamura, Nisipeanu, and Ivanchuk and drew the rest of the games.[119]

Carlsen won the 44th Biel Grandmaster tournament, held from 16 to 29 July. He took clear first place with a score of 19/30 (+5−1=4; three points for a win) in a field comprising Fabiano Caruana, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Alexander Morozevich, Alexey Shirov and Yannick Pelletier, two points ahead of Morozevich. This was Carlsen's second title.[120][121]

The Grand Slam Chess Final was held as a double round robin with six players, in São Paulo (25 September – 1 October) and Bilbao (5–11 October). Although Carlsen had a slow start, including a loss against bottom-ranked Francisco Vallejo Pons, he finished +3−1=6, equal with Ivanchuk (whose +4−3=3 finish was equal due to three points for a win). Carlsen then won the blitz tiebreak against Ivanchuk. The other players were Anand, Aronian, Nakamura, and Vallejo Pons.[122]

Another tournament victory was achieved in the Tal Memorial in Moscow 16–25 November as a round robin with ten players. Carlsen won two games, against Gelfand and Nakamura, and drew the rest. Although he finished equal on points with Aronian, he placed ahead since the tiebreak was determined by the number of black games; Carlsen had five black games, while Aronian only had four.[123][124]

In the London Chess Classic, played 3–12 December, Carlsen's streak of tournament victories ended when he finished third, behind Kramnik and Nakamura. Carlsen won three games and drew five. Although he did not win the tournament, Carlsen gained rating points, rising to a new personal record of 2835.[125]

2012

Carlsen at the 74th Tata Steel Chess Tournament in 2012
At the 74th Tata Steel Chess Tournament held on 14–29 January in Wijk aan Zee, Carlsen finished in a shared second place with 8/13, behind Aronian, and equal with Radjabov and Caruana. Carlsen defeated Gashimov, Aronian, Gelfand, and Topalov, but lost against Karjakin.[126] At the blitz chess tournament at Tal Memorial, held in Moscow on 7 June, Carlsen shared first place with Morozevich. In the main event (a category 22 ten-player round robin), he won two games and drew seven. He finished in first place, ahead of Radjabov and Caruana.[127]

Carlsen then went on to finish second in the Biel Grandmaster Tournament, with 18 points, just one point behind Wang Hao using the 3–1–0 scoring system. As in the Tal Memorial earlier in 2012, Carlsen managed to finish the tournament without any losses (+4−0=6). He also defeated the winner Wang in both of their individual games. In the exhibition blitz tournament at Biel before the GM tournament, Carlsen was eliminated (+1−2=0) in the first round by Étienne Bacrot. Bacrot deprived Carlsen of a win in the classical tournament by holding him to a draw in the final round. Carlsen would have won the classical tournament on the traditional 1–½–0 scoring system, with 7/10.[128]

The Grand Slam Chess Final was again held as a double round robin with six players, in São Paulo and Bilbao. Carlsen started with a loss against Caruana, but after three wins in the second (Bilbao) round, finished +4−1=5, equal first with Caruana, and ahead of Aronian, Karjakin and Anand. Carlsen won the tournament by winning both tiebreak games against Caruana.[129]

From 24 to 25 November, Carlsen took part in the chess festival "Segunda Gran Fiesta Internacional de Ajedrez" in Mexico City. As part of it, Carlsen took on an online audience (dubbed as "The World") with the white pieces and won. He then took part in the knockout exhibition event "Cuadrangular UNAM".

In January, Carlsen won the 77th Tata Steel Chess Tournament, which was played mainly in Wijk aan Zee on 9–25 January. Carlsen had a poor start to the tournament with two draws and a loss in the third round to Radosław Wojtaszek, which left him in tenth place among the fourteen players. However, six consecutive wins thrust Carlsen into clear first place. Drawing the final four games was sufficient to win the tournament with 9 points out of 13, half a point ahead of Anish Giri, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Wesley So and Ding Liren.[153][154]

In February, Carlsen won the 3rd Grenke Chess Classic after a five-game tiebreak with Arkadij Naiditsch. Carlsen had finished joint first with Naiditsch on 4½/7, beating Michael Adams, Anand, and David Baramidze, and losing to Naiditsch in their classical encounter.[155] This tournament victory meant that Carlsen began 2015 by winning two out of two tournaments. Carlsen continued his streak in April, winning Shamkir Chess with a score of 7/9 (+5−0=4), defeating Mamedyarov, Caruana, Vachier-Lagrave, Kramnik, and Rauf Mamedov.

Carlsen had a poor result in the third edition of Norway Chess, held 15–26 June. In the first round he obtained a winning position against Topalov after pressing in a long endgame, only to lose on time when he mistakenly thought that he would receive 15 minutes of extra time at move 60.[157] He was then outplayed by Caruana in the second round, missed a win against Anish Giri in round 3, and lost to Anand in round 4. He won against Grischuk in round 5, drew against Nakamura and Vachier-Lagrave in rounds 6 and 7, and defeated Aronian in round 8, but he lost the last round against Jon Ludvig Hammer, leaving him in seventh place and with a performance rating of 2693.[158] Carlsen said of this result: "It's just extremely frustrating not to be able to show anything close to what I am capable of in my home country."[159]

During the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted the cancellation of many physical tournaments, Carlsen organized the Magnus Carlsen Invitational along with Chess24. Billed as "the first professional online chess tournament," the eight-player rapid tournament was held from 18 April to 3 May, with a $250,000 prize fund. The first phase consisted of a single round-robin, after which the top four players would advance to the playoffs.[230] Carlsen won the event by defeating Hikaru Nakamura 2½–1½ in the final.[231]

Carlsen competed in the 8th Norway Chess from 5 to 16 October, which was the first elite over-the-board tournament held since social restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic were enforced.[232] During the tournament, Carlsen's unbeaten streak in classical chess was ended by Jan-Krzysztof Duda.[233] Carlsen had gone 125 games without defeat, a period spanning 2 years, 2 months and 10 days.[232] He ultimately won the tournament with a round to spare,[234] finishing on 19½ points, one point ahead of runner-up Alireza Firouzja.[235]

2021
In January, Carlsen participated in the 83rd Tata Steel Chess Tournament. He finished in sixth place with a score of 7½/13, losing one game to young Russian grandmaster Andrey Esipenko.[236] This was Carlsen's first loss to a teenager (at standard time controls) since 2011,[237] and his first loss to a sub-2700 rated player since 2015.[238]

Throughout the year, Carlsen also participated in many online chess tournaments as part of the Meltwater Champions Chess Tour.

At the FIDE World Cup 2021 held in Sochi, Carlsen won the third place match against Fedoseev after being defeated in the semi-finals by Duda, who eventually won the event.[239]

Carlsen then won the 9th Norway Chess, again finishing on 19½ points ahead of runner-up Alireza Firouzja. After his sole loss in the fifth round of the classical portion to Karjakin, Carlsen won four straight games in classical chess against Firouzja, Tari, Karjakin, and Rapport before ending the tournament with a classical draw and armageddon win against his future World Championship challenger Ian Nepomniachtchi.[240]

From 26 to 28 December, Carlsen participated in the World Rapid Chess Championship 2021. He took 3rd place (by tiebreakers) with a score of 9½/13 (+7-1=5). Over the next two days, from 29 to 30 December he took part in the World Blitz Chess Championship 2021. He performed poorly, finishing 12th with a score of 13½/21 (+12−6=3).

At the 2021 World Chess Championship, Carlsen defeated challenger Ian Nepomniachtchi in Game 6 after drawing the first five games. It was the first decisive result in a classical time limit World Chess Championship game in more than 5 years and at 136 moves was also the longest game in World Chess Championship history.[241] Subsequently, Carlsen also defeated Nepomniachtchi in Games 8, 9, and 11, thus retaining his championship title.[242] After the match, Carlsen announced that "Unless Firouzja wins the Candidates Tournament, it is unlikely that I will play the next world championship match."[243]

In January, Carlsen won his eighth Tata Steel Chess Tournament. He finished with a score of 9½/13, with no losses and six wins, including wins against Shakhriyar Mamedyarov and Fabiano Caruana.[244]

In early June, Carlsen placed first in the Norway Chess Tournament, ahead of Shakhriyar Mamedyarov and Viswanathan Anand who finished second and third, respectively.[245] He finished with a score of 16½/30,[245] with no losses and three wins, including wins against Teimour Radjabov, Anish Giri and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov. This was Carlsen's fourth consecutive win of the prestigious super tournament and fifth overall in the last decade.

On 20 July, the deadline FIDE had given him, Carlsen announced that he would not defend his World Championship title against Nepomniachtchi in the 2023 World Chess Championship match.[246] Carlsen said he enjoyed playing chess tournaments more than championships,[247] and would still continue playing professional chess.[248]

Throughout the year, Carlsen competed in the Champions Chess Tour 2022.[249] He won the Airthings Masters, Charity Cup, and FTX Crypto Cup.

Carlsen joined the Norway team for the 44th Chess Olympiad.[249] He was the runner-up in the Chess.com Speed Championship.[250]

Carlsen won the World Rapid Chess Championship 2022 with a score of 10/13 (+8-1=4). He also won the World Blitz Chess Championship 2022 with a score of 16/21 (+13-2=6). This marks the third time in Carlsen's career that he has simultaneously held the Classical, Rapid, and Blitz World Titles, with 2014 and 2019 being the other two occurrences.

Sinquefield Cup withdrawal
Main article: Carlsen–Niemann controversy
In August and September, Carlsen participated as a wildcard in the 2022 Sinquefield Cup as part of the Grand Chess Tour 2022. He won his first game against Nepomniachtchi, the Candidates Tournament 2022 winner. He subsequently drew his second game to Levon Aronian, leaving him in tied first place with American wildcard Hans Niemann. In the third game, Carlsen was defeated by Niemann, ending his 53-game unbeaten streak in classical chess that chess24 described as a "stunning victory".[251][252] Carlsen soon after announced his withdrawal in a tweet with a video of Portuguese football manager José Mourinho saying, "I prefer really not to speak. If I speak, I am in big trouble."[253][254] The New York Times stated that "online observers interpreted Mr. Carlsen's post as insinuating that Mr. Niemann cheated in some way during the game", though no concrete evidence of cheating had been found.[255] Carlsen's previous results still affect his FIDE rating; however, they will be removed from the tournament standing.[254] This was the first time in Carlsen's career to withdraw from a major event in progress, and was considered "virtually unprecedented" in top level chess.[254]

Two weeks later, Carlsen faced Niemann in the Julius Baer Generation Cup, a section of the Champions Chess Tour 2022, an online chess tour. Carlsen, playing as black, resigned after one move, continuing the scandal.[256] On 26 September, Carlsen finally broke his silence and accused Niemann of cheating.[257] Subsequently, on 20 October Niemann filed a lawsuit against Carlsen and four other defendants, alleging five counts of action, including libel and slander.[258][259] The case was dismissed in June 2023, with the judge ruling that the claim of defamation was outside her federal jurisdiction.[260] In December 2023, the FIDE Ethics & Disciplinary Commission fined Carlsen €10,000 for his withdrawal from the tournament.[261][262]

2023

Carlsen at the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2023
In January, Carlsen participated in the Tata Steel Chess Tournament. He lost consecutive games, which had not happened since 2015, first to Anish Giri and then to the young Uzbek prodigy Nodirbek Abdusattorov.[263] He recovered and finished 3rd, with the same score as Abdusattorov, but behind Giri, who won the tournament.[264] In February, Carlsen participated in the Airthings Masters 2023 which he won by defeating the American Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura in the finals.

Having earlier declined to defend his World Championship title, Carlsen ceased to be World Champion at the completion of the title match between Ding Liren and Ian Nepomniachtchi (the World Chess Championship 2023), won by Ding. In an interview after the match, Carlsen said he was "suffering from a lack of motivation to play classical chess, because of the dominance of opening preparation".[265] Subsequently, he did not enter the cycle for the World Chess Championship 2024.

Carlsen competed in the Norway Chess tournament, and performed poorly with a score of 11½/27, drawing 8 classical games, losing 1, and winning 0. He managed to win 7/8 Armageddon blitz games (after a drawn classical game).

Carlsen competed in two Grand Chess Tour events as wild cards, winning both, the Poland Rapid & Blitz and Croatia Rapid & Blitz.

In the 2023 Chess World Cup, Carlsen reached the finals by defeating 65th seed Aryan Tari in the third round, 32nd seed Vincent Keymer in the fourth round, Vasyl Ivanchuk in the fifth round, Gukesh D in the quarterfinals, and Nijat Abasov in the semi-finals. Carlsen was sickened by food poisoning during the tournament.[266] In the finals against R Praggnanandhaa, Carlsen won during the tiebreaks, making it his first time winning a World Cup.[266][267]

He defeated Alireza Firouzja in the final of the 2023 Julius Baer Generation Cup to clinch his third tournament victory on the 2023 Champions Chess Tour.[268]

Carlsen won his third Speed Chess Championship, beating five-time defending champion Hikaru Nakamura in the final to deny him a sixth consecutive title.[269]

Carlsen beat Wesley So in the 2023 Champions Chess Tour finals to win the Champions Chess Tour for a third consecutive year.[270]

Carlsen won the World Rapid Chess Championship 2023 with a score of 10/13 (+7-0=6). He won his 5th World Rapid Chess Championship title. He also won the World Blitz Chess Championship 2023 with a score of 16/21 (+12-1=8). He won his 7th World Blitz Chess Championship title. He became the first man to successfully defend both the rapid and blitz titles simultaneously in the world championships.[271]

2024
In February, Carlsen participated in the Champions Chess Tour Chessable Masters competition, where he won the grand finale for a $30,000 prize.[272][273]

In February, Carlsen organized and played in the Freestyle Chess G.O.A.T. Challenge, which was an over-the-board Fischer random chess tournament which included some of the top players in the world. He placed fifth in the round-robin rapid portion of the tournament, which determined the pairings for the main event, which was played under classical time controls. He won the main event, beating Fabiano Caruana in the final for a $60,000 prize.[274] It was the first ever classical Fischer random chess super-tournament.[275]

In September, Carlsen won his fourth Speed Chess Championship title, defeating GM Alireza Firouzja in the finals held in Paris, France. Carlsen displayed a dominant performance, finishing with a score of 23.5-7.5, winning 21 games, drawing 5, and losing only 5 in the four-hour match. Carlsen and GM Hikaru Nakamura remain the only players to have won the tournament since its inception in 2016.[276] Also in September, Carlsen played in the 45th Chess Olympiad for Team Norway, and they placed 14th out of 188 countries. Carlsen finished with a score of 6/8, conceding draws to Mustafa Yilmaz, and Parham Maghsoodloo, while only losing to Vladimir Fedoseev. A notable win was against Vietnam GM Liem Le.[277] To finish September, Carlsen also took home the 2024 Julius Baer Generation Cup, by going undefeated and beating Alireza Firouzja 2.5-1.5 in the Grand Final.[278]

On 21 December, Carlsen defeated Ian Nepomniachtchi in the finals of Champions Chess Tour 2024, winning the tournament for a fifth consecutive time.[279][280]

On 27 December, following round six of the World Rapid Chess Championship, Carlsen was warned and fined USD$200 for wearing jeans. He refused to change his jeans after being given the opportunity to change attire, causing him to not be paired for round nine. He proceeded to withdraw himself from both the Rapid and the World Blitz Chess Championship tournaments, remarking in an interview, "They can enforce their rules, that's fine by me [...] my response is that fine, then I'm out, like, fuck you."[281][282][283][284][285] On December 29, after a loosening of the dress code, Carlsen reversed his decision and announced he would take part in the Blitz tournament.[286][287] International Chess Federation President Arkady Dvorkovich acknowledged that the incident brought attention to the importance of the organization's ability to adapt to the "evolving nature of chess as a global and accessible sport" regarding the application of its rules.[288] He also professed his "regret" for a resolution not being able to be found before Carlsen's withdrawal.[289][290] Carlsen went on to jointly win the Blitz championship when he and Ian Nepomniachtchi agreed to share the title having been deadlocked after seven games in the final.[291][292] Carlsen's decision received applause from the live audience, but met negative reactions online from professional chess players and fans. Dissenters included American chess grandmaster Hans Niemann, who tweeted, "The chess world is officially a joke. [...] I can’t believe that the official body of chess is being controlled by a singular player [for the second time this week]."[293][294][295]

Honours
Carlsen won the Chess Oscars from 2009 to 2013. The Chess Oscar, organised by the Russian chess magazine 64, was awarded to the year's best player according to a worldwide poll of leading chess critics, writers, and journalists, but it was no longer awarded after 2013, as 64 ceased publication.[481][482]

The Norwegian tabloid Verdens Gang (VG) has awarded Carlsen the "Name of the Year" (Årets navn) twice, in 2009[483] and 2013.[484] VG also named him "Sportsman of the Year" in 2009.[485] Carlsen has also won the Folkets Idrettspris, a people's choice award from the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet, in 2009[486] and 2010.[487]

In 2011, he was awarded the Peer Gynt Prize, a Norwegian prize awarded annually to "a person or institution that has achieved distinction in society".[488]

In 2013, Time magazine named Carlsen one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[489]

Rating

Carlsen's Elo rating evolution from 2002 to 2023
In the January 2006 FIDE rankings, at the age of 15 years and 32 days, Carlsen attained a 2625 Elo rating, which made him the youngest person to surpass 2600[490] (the record has since been broken by Wesley So, Wei Yi, John M. Burke, and Yağız Kaan Erdoğmuş[491]). In the July 2007 FIDE rankings, at the age of 16 years and 213 days, Carlsen attained a 2710 Elo rating, which made him the youngest person to surpass 2700 (the record has since been broken by Wei Yi).[492]

On 5 September 2008, after winning in round 4 of the Bilbao Masters, Carlsen, aged 17 years and 280 days old, briefly became No. 1 on the unofficial live ratings list.[493][494] Carlsen's victory in the 2009 Nanjing Pearl tournament raised his FIDE rating to 2801, making him, aged 18 years and 336 days, at the time the youngest player ever to surpass 2800[85] (a record subsequently broken by Alireza Firouzja).[495] The youngest before Carlsen to achieve this feat was Vladimir Kramnik at the age of 25,[496] and up until this point only Kasparov, Topalov, Kramnik, and Anand had achieved a 2800+ rating.[497]

The FIDE rankings in January 2010 recorded Carlsen's rating at 2810, which made him No. 1 rated player in the world.[498] This meant that Carlsen became, at the age of 19 years and 32 days, the youngest ever world No. 1, as well as the first player from a Western nation to reach the top of the FIDE rankings since Bobby Fischer in 1971.[499][500][501]

The March 2010 FIDE rankings showed Carlsen with a new peak rating of 2813, a figure that only Kasparov had bettered at that time.[99] On the January 2013 FIDE rankings, Carlsen reached 2861, thus surpassing Garry Kasparov's 2851 record from July 1999.[132][133] In the May 2014 rankings, Carlsen achieved an all-time high record of 2882,[502] with a peak of 2889 on the live ratings list achieved on 21 April 2014.[503] In August 2019 he equalled his peak FIDE rating of 2882.[504]

As of December 2024, Carlsen is also ranked No. 1 in the FIDE rapid rating list with a rating of 2838, and No. 1 in the FIDE blitz rating list with a rating of 2890.[505]

Playing style
Carlsen had an aggressive style of play as a youth,[506][507] and, according to Simen Agdestein, his play was characterised by "a fearless readiness to offer material for activity".[508] As he matured, Carlsen found that this risky playing style was not as well suited against the elite of the chess world. When he started playing in top tournaments, he had trouble getting much out of the opening. To progress, Carlsen's style became more universal, capable of handling all sorts of positions well. He opens with both 1.d4 and 1.e4, as well as 1.c4, and, on occasion, 1.Nf3, thus making it harder for opponents to prepare against him and reducing the effect of computer analysis.[509][510][511] He said in 2015 that the middlegame is his favourite part of the game as it comes down to "pure chess".[509]

In a 2016 interview, Anish Giri said: "Magnus and I are very close in terms of style, but in our approach to the game we're total opposites. Magnus tries to put the accent only on play, getting away from preparation, but for me preparation plays an enormous role."[512]

[Carlsen] has been known to say that he isn't all that interested in opening preparation; his main forte is the middlegame, in which he manages to outplay many of his opponents with positional means. ... Carlsen's repertoire is aimed at avoiding an early crisis in the game. He invariably aims for middlegames that lend themselves to a strategic approach.

Jan Timman, 2012[513]
Garry Kasparov, who coached Carlsen from 2009 to 2010, said that Carlsen has a positional style similar to that of past world champions such as Anatoly Karpov, José Raúl Capablanca, and Vasily Smyslov, rather than the tactical style of Alexander Alekhine, Mikhail Tal, and Kasparov himself.[514] In a 2013 interview, Peter Heine Nielsen said: "The days of big novelties are over, and that fits Magnus' style well."[515] According to Carlsen, however, he does not have any preferences in playing style.[516] Kasparov said in 2013 that "Carlsen is a combination of Karpov [and] Fischer. He gets his positions [and] then never lets go of that bulldog bite. Exhausting for opponents."[517][non-primary source needed] Carlsen has also stated that he follows in the traditions of Karpov and Fischer, but additionally mentions Reuben Fine as a player who "was doing in chess similar to what I am doing".[518]

Anand said of Carlsen in 2012: "Magnus has an incredible innate sense. ... The majority of ideas occur to him absolutely naturally. He's also very flexible, he knows all the structures and he can play almost any position." He also compared Carlsen to Boris Spassky in his prime, and stated that "Magnus can literally do almost everything."[519] Kasparov expressed similar sentiments: "[Carlsen] has the ability to correctly evaluate any position, which only Karpov could boast of before him."[520] When asked in a 2016 interview whether Carlsen's style resembles his own, Karpov answered: "It is quite possible. He grew up when I was in power, and perhaps he studied my games. He can convert a minimal advantage into a real one."[521]

In a 2012 interview, Vladimir Kramnik stated that Carlsen's "excellent physical shape" was a contributing factor to his success against other top players as it prevents "psychological lapses", which enables him to maintain a high standard of play over long games and at the end of tournaments, when the energy levels of others have dropped.[522] Levon Aronian said in 2015: "Magnus' main secret is his composure and the absence of any soul-searching after mistakes during a game."[523] Tyler Cowen gave a point of view on Carlsen's playing style: "Carlsen is demonstrating one of his most feared qualities, namely his 'nettlesomeness,' to use a term coined for this purpose by Ken Regan, of the University at Buffalo.[524] Using computer analysis, you can measure which players do the most to cause their opponents to make mistakes. Carlsen has the highest nettlesomeness score by this metric, because his creative moves pressure the other player and open up a lot of room for mistakes. In contrast, a player such as Kramnik plays a high percentage of very accurate moves, and of course he is very strong, but those moves are in some way calmer and they are less likely to induce mistakes in response."[525]

Carlsen's endgame prowess has been singled out for praise.[526][527][528] Jon Speelman, analysing several of Carlsen's endgames from the 2012 London Classic (in particular, his wins against McShane, Aronian, and Adams), described what he calls the "Carlsen effect":

... through the combined force of his skill and no less important his reputation, he drives his opponents into errors. ... He plays on for ever, calmly, methodically and, perhaps most importantly of all, without fear: calculating superbly, with very few outright mistakes and a good proportion of the "very best" moves. This makes him a monster and makes many opponents wilt.[529]

An artificial intelligence approach, designed by Jean-Marc Alliot of the Institut de recherche en informatique de Toulouse ("Toulouse Computer Science Research Institute"), which compares chess grandmaster moves against that of Stockfish—a chess engine that outperforms all human opponents—rated Carlsen as the best player of all time as he had the highest probability among all World Chess Champions to play the moves that Stockfish suggested.[530]

Carlsen also plays speed chess online under many screen names. He is known for meme openings such as the Bongcloud Attack and exceptionally strong play, despite banter and gags.[531]

Notable games
Carlsen vs. Garry Kasparov, Reykjavík Rapid (2004), Queen's Gambit Declined: Cambridge Springs Defense (D52), ½–½.[games 1] At the age of just 13 years, Carlsen had serious winning chances in a rapid game against Kasparov,[37] who was ranked No. 1 in the world at that time.[532]
Carlsen vs. Veselin Topalov, M-Tel Masters (2009), Semi-Slav Defense: General (D43), 1–0.[games 2] This was Carlsen's first win against a 2800+ player.[533]
Carlsen vs. Boris Gelfand, Tal Memorial (2011), Slav Defense: Quiet Variation. Schallopp Defense (D12), 1–0.[534][games 3] The No. 1 Israeli player creates a seemingly decisive rook invasion into White's back rank, but Carlsen vanquishes the threats. Carlsen called it "one of the most interesting games I have played in recent times".[535]
Carlsen vs. Hikaru Nakamura, London Chess Classic (2011), Italian Game: Classical Variation. Giuoco Pianissimo (C53), 1–0.[games 4] Facing the No. 1 American player, Carlsen sacrifices the exchange to achieve a winning position in an otherwise near-equal game.
Carlsen vs. Viswanathan Anand, Bilbao Masters (2012), Sicilian Defense: Canal Attack. Main Line (B52), 1–0.[games 5] Playing against the then-World Champion, Carlsen sacrifices a pawn to leave Black with a cramped position, which leads to Anand's resignation at move 30. Carlsen stated in 2013 that he considers this game to be one of his very best.[536]
Carlsen vs. Li Chao, Qatar Masters (2015), Neo-Grünfeld Defence: Goglidze Attack (D70), 1–0.[games 6] Playing against one of the leading Chinese GMs, Carlsen finds a winning attack by sacrificing his queen in a sharp position.
Carlsen vs. Ian Nepomniachtchi, 2021 World Championship game 6 (2021), Queen's Pawn Game, Symmetrical Variation, Pseudo-Catalan, 1–0. Game 6 was a 136-move win for Carlsen that lasted 7 hours 45 minutes. As of 2023, it is the longest game in the history of the World Chess Championship, surpassing the previous record, a 124-move draw in game 5 of the World Chess Championship 1978 between Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi.
Business endeavours

Carlsen in May 2013
Carlsen modelled for G-Star Raw's Fall/Winter 2010 advertising campaign along with American actress Liv Tyler. The campaign was shot by Dutch film director and photographer Anton Corbijn.[537] The campaign was coordinated with the RAW World Chess Challenge in New York, an event in which Carlsen played an online team of global chess players, who voted on moves suggested by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Hikaru Nakamura and Judit Polgár. Carlsen, playing white, won in 43 moves.[538] In February 2014, he appeared in G-Star Raw's Spring/Summer 2014 campaign along with actress and model Lily Cole.[539]

Film director J. J. Abrams offered Carlsen a role in the movie Star Trek Into Darkness as "a chess player from the future", but Carlsen was unable to get a work permit in time for shooting.[540] In 2012, Carlsen was featured in a 60 Minutes segment[541] and appeared as a guest on The Colbert Report.[542] He was also interviewed by Rainn Wilson for SoulPancake in 2013.[543]

As of 2012, Carlsen is the only active chess professional with a full-time manager; Espen Agdestein, a FIDE Master and brother of Carlsen's former trainer Simen Agdestein, began working as an agent for Carlsen in late 2008.[544] Agdestein's work consisted initially of finding sponsors and negotiating media contacts but, since 2011, he has taken over management tasks formerly performed by Carlsen's father Henrik.[545] According to The New York Times, Carlsen earned US$1.2 million in 2012, the bulk of which was from sponsorships.[546]

In August 2013, Carlsen became an ambassador for Nordic Semiconductor,[547] and in November was selected as one of the "sexiest men of 2013" by Cosmopolitan.[548] In 2017, Carlsen made a special guest appearance on The Simpsons in an episode where Homer's chess history is revealed.[549] In 2020, Carlsen announced that he had signed a two-year sponsorship deal with gambling company Unibet to act as a "global ambassador".[550] Unibet parent company Kindred Group is also a sponsor of Offerspill Chess Club. Offerspill was founded by Carlsen in 2019 after the Norwegian Chess Federation turned down Kindred's sponsorship offer. It is now Norway's largest chess club; Carlsen is its current chairman.[551] In April 2022, the Kindred Group (through Unibet) extended its partnership with Carlsen for another two years, and also extended its sponsorship of Offerspill.[552]

Play Magnus
Main article: Play Magnus Group
In October 2013, Carlsen co-founded a company, Play Magnus AS, with Espen Agdestein and Anders Brandt.[553] Based in Oslo, Norway, Play Magnus' first product was an iOS app, called Play Magnus, that allows the user to play a chess engine created using a database of thousands of Carlsen's recorded games from the age of five and up. Carlsen stated he wished for the app to encourage more people to play chess.[554][555]

In March 2019, Play Magnus AS merged with chess24.com, consolidating into the Play Magnus Group.[556] On 8 October 2020, Play Magnus Group was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Magnus Chess, an entity controlled by Carlsen and his family, then owned 9.5% of Play Magnus Group.[557]

In August 2022, Chess.com finalised an offer of acquisition for Play Magnus Group, which officially closed on 16 December 2022. As part of the acquisition, Carlsen signed as a brand ambassador for Chess.com.[558][559][560]

Take Take Take
In October 2024, Magnus Carlsen cofounded Take Take Take. It was the first app in Chess World which offered text-based commentary to fantasy chess, from live games to post-game recaps, and from challenges to some app exclusive content.[561] Take Take Take then tied with Chess.com to jointly organise Champions Chess Tour Finals in December 2024.[562]

Personal life
As of 2016, Carlsen identifies as a social democrat and mostly follows a vegetarian diet; two of his sisters are vegetarians.[563]

Carlsen is an avid fan of association football, with Real Madrid CF as his favourite club. In recognition of becoming world chess champion, he took the honorary kick-off in a La Liga game between Real Madrid and Real Valladolid on 30 November 2013.[564] Carlsen also follows the Premier League and plays fantasy football. In December 2019, he reached the No. 1 spot on a Fantasy Premier League game, ahead of seven million other players, before eventually finishing the season in 10th place.[565][566]

Carlsen has been in a relationship with Ella Victoria Malone since at least February 2024. In early January 2025, it was announced that they would be getting married during the first weekend of the month in a private ceremony.[567][568] The wedding ceremony took place at Holmenkollen Chapel in the Vestre Aker borough of Oslo, Norway, on 4 January 2025.[569][570]
